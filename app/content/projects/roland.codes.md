    My personal website/blog.
---

Built all the HTML, CSS, Javascript, build process and custom static site generator setup. Also built the server that hosts the website (which is a [DigitalOcean][] VPS). I rebuilt it to better represent/show my skills and used it as an opportunity to try out some new technologies and create a custom static site generator setup that suits my needs.

The beautiful design was done by [Arlen McCluskey][arlen].
