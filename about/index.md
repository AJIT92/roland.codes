My name is Roland Warmerdam and I’m a programmer in New Zealand. I program in a number of technologies, but I specialise in frontend web development. I enjoy experimenting and developing web apps using the latest web standards and learning about new languages and technologies. I’m also an avid Linux user and dabble in server administration on my virtual private server (on which this website is hosted).
